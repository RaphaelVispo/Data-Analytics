# Data-Analytics

My Data Science journey Begins...

The following are my projects:

## Change in Higher Education Graduates from A.Y. 2009-10 to 2018-19
- Data is from the Commision on Higher Education. Link: [data](https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/Higher-Education-Graduates-by-Discipline-Group-AY-2010-11-to-2018-19.pdf)
- The project inclues data cleaning. 
- The libraries used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seeborn


This repository will be my first look at at my trial of different things about data. Learning new things each day every day! 
Goodluck!
